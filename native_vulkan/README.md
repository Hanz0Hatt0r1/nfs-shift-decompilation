# Linux Vulkan backend

The native Vulkan backend consumes the neutral render contracts used by the desktop reference path.

## Implemented stages

- Vulkan instance/device/queue bootstrap;
- headless image/transfer checkpoint;
- RenderCommand geometry packet;
- vertex-layout packet;
- constant packet;
- texture/sampler packet;
- cubemap packet;
- SPIR-V reflection and interface gates;
- BMW material→DDS→Vulkan adapter;
- separately tested, bounded decoding of the captured Xbox `PM4_DRAW_INDX`
  and vertex/texture fetch descriptors, plus normalization for the captured
  index/vertex byte orders. The captured 1024x256, format-6, tiled 2D texture
  can also be converted to linear texel order with its 8-in-32 byte swap. The
  descriptor decoder maps the captured channel selectors, signs, X/Y/Z clamp
  modes, border code, filters, and anisotropy to semantic values; they are not
  yet applied to a Vulkan view or sampler. The captured black border code has
  unresolved alpha, so the backend does not guess a Vulkan border color. The
  captured color/depth target, viewport, and screen/window scissor are also
  decoded into a bounded neutral state contract. This does not map Xenos EDRAM
  tiles to Vulkan images or create a pipeline. The constants decoder resolves
  each stage's 256-register float window and the observed PS branch bools,
  including the VS a0-indexed c0-c3 window.
  A bounded decoder parses the captured VS/PS control-flow slots and their
  `vfetch_full` and `tfetch2D` instructions, plus scheduled ALU operands,
  temporary-register addressing flags, scalar source selectors, and
  component-relative swizzles. The project-owned translator now emits Vulkan
  GLSL for the observed VS/PS pair, including its `b128`/`b129` branch path,
  vertex fetch, captured ALU subset, texture fetch/swizzle, and exports. It
  rejects unsupported control flow and operations. The actual captured pair
  compiled to Vulkan 1.1-compatible SPIR-V and passed `spirv-val`.
  The packet scanner frames contiguous big-endian type 0/1/2/3 PM4 packets and
  reports type-3 opcodes without applying state or executing commands. The
  project-owned `snapshot_guest_ring_batch` copies a committed dword-indexed
  ring interval, including wraparound, then frames its packets. The adjacent
  size helper bounds ReXGlue's `1 << (size_log2 + 3)` ring capacity before use.
  The PM4 type-0/type-1 decoder exposes raw register-write pairs without
  applying GPU state.
  A regression carries the captured `DRAW_INDX` across the ring boundary. It
  is not yet wired to ReXGlue's live write-pointer service and does not apply
  register state.
  The private 19,784-byte capture scans as 247 packets with four bounded
  `DRAW_INDX` packets. The capture decoders reject unsupported forms. The untile
  path rejects other pitches, formats, dimensions, and layouts. Its address
  mapping is cross-checked against the public
  [Xenia `Tiled2D` implementation](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/blob/master/src/xenia/gpu/texture_address.h);
  descriptor enum meanings are cross-checked against the public
  [Xenos register definitions](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/blob/master/src/xenia/gpu/xenos.h).
  These are documentation cross-checks only: this project has no Xenia runtime
  dependency and does not emulate a Xenos GPU;
- the first captured Xbox `DRAW_INDX` (six 16-bit indices, four captured
  `FLOAT3` vertices, the captured 1024x256 texture, constants, and translated
  shaders) has been submitted by `shift_vulkan_bundle_execute` to the
  project-owned Vulkan backend. That path uses Vulkan 1.1, an sRGB color target,
  captured viewport/blend/cull state, and a project-owned Xbox target/gate
  contract. The native run enabled `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` and reported
  zero validation errors. The output shows the captured SHIFT logo draw; it is
  evidence of one submitted draw, not full-frame retail parity. The source
  capture was obtained with an Xenos diagnostic run, but neither its renderer
  nor its SPIR-V is used by the project-owned Vulkan path. The same offscreen
  bundle also submitted on Android arm64-v8a / Redmi Note 8 Pro (Mali-G76 MC4).
  Android validation layers were unavailable; its output differed from the
  GTX 950 host output by at most 2/255 per RGB channel, so this is a device
  execution check rather than pixel-identical or retail-frame parity;
- limitations for this isolated draw: the prior EDRAM contents were not
  captured, so the standalone bundle begins with an explicit black clear; the
  captured black texture-border alpha is unresolved, so the test bundle uses
  Vulkan transparent-black border behavior provisionally. The tested ring-span
  reader is not wired to ReXGlue's live write-pointer service, and the ReXGlue
  plugin/runtime is not yet integrated with this renderer. Register/resource
  state ingestion and broader shader coverage remain future integration work.
  The product path must use a project-owned ReXGlue graphics frontend and must
  not load `rexgpu-xenos` or another GPU emulator;
- Linux CI coverage for native smoke paths.

## Rules

1. RenderCommand/1 is the source contract.
2. Native execution targets SPIR-V; GLSL is validation/debug representation.
3. MEB repack decisions stay upstream.
4. Buffers/images/descriptors use explicit contracts.
5. The backend does not infer undocumented game semantics.

## Current limitation

The backend is not yet a complete production renderer. Full BMW
shader/material execution and full RenderCommand submission remain bounded by
shader/reference coverage and runtime evidence. The Xbox work currently covers
one captured draw and a small, fail-closed microcode subset.

## Commands

```bash
cmake -S native_vulkan -B native_vulkan/build
cmake --build native_vulkan/build --config Release
ctest --test-dir native_vulkan/build --output-on-failure
./native_vulkan/build/shift_vulkan_probe
./native_vulkan/build/shift_vulkan_headless_clear out/shift_vulkan_headless.ppm
```

The headless path has no window-system dependency.


## RenderCommand provenance gate

BMW bundle preparation accepts `SHIFT.RenderCommand/1` but now blocks native
bundle generation unless the selected submesh passes `SHIFT.NativeSubmissionGate/1`.
That gate requires complete FXO payload provenance and
`SHIFT.ShaderPermutationIdentity/1` for the shader pair.

This is a provenance gate, not a claim of runtime shader equivalence.


## Validate native bundle execution

```bash
python3 tools/run_linux_vulkan_smoke.py out/vulkan/bundle --validation
# Or execute an already prepared bundle directly:
native_vulkan/build/shift_vulkan_bundle_execute out/vulkan/bundle/bundle --validation
```

`--validation` explicitly enables `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` and its debug
messenger. Install `vulkan-validationlayers` on Ubuntu/Debian. If the layer or
extension is missing, startup fails. Any validation error makes native execution
fail even if a PPM was produced; the Python runner propagates that failure.
Successful native JSON includes `validation_enabled` and `validation_errors`.
Warnings go to stderr. CI requires validation for the mixed-resource smoke run.
Depth image views are created with the depth aspect directly.
