# Linux Vulkan backend

The native Vulkan backend consumes the neutral render contracts used by the desktop reference path.

## Implemented stages

- Vulkan instance/device/queue bootstrap;
- headless image/transfer checkpoint;
- RenderCommand geometry packet;
- vertex-layout packet;
- constant packet;
- texture/sampler packet;
- cubemap packet;
- SPIR-V reflection and interface gates;
- BMW material→DDS→Vulkan adapter;
- Linux CI coverage for native smoke paths.

## Rules

1. RenderCommand/1 is the source contract.
2. Native execution targets SPIR-V; GLSL is validation/debug representation.
3. MEB repack decisions stay upstream.
4. Buffers/images/descriptors use explicit contracts.
5. The backend does not infer undocumented game semantics.

## Current limitation

The backend is not yet a complete production renderer. Full BMW shader/material execution and full RenderCommand submission remain bounded by shader/reference coverage and runtime evidence.

## Commands

```bash
cmake -S native_vulkan -B native_vulkan/build
cmake --build native_vulkan/build --config Release
./native_vulkan/build/shift_vulkan_probe
./native_vulkan/build/shift_vulkan_headless_clear out/shift_vulkan_headless.ppm
```

The headless path has no window-system dependency.
