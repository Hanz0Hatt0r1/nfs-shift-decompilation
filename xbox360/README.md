# Xbox 360 primary port workspace

This directory is reserved for **Need for Speed: SHIFT Xbox 360 retail** work via [ReXGlue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk).

**Currently this is a skeleton, not a working game build.** No title-specific XEX, ReXGlue config, PPC output, Vulkan gameplay or Android package is checked into the repo.

## Work areas

- [`rexglue/`](rexglue/README.md) — external SDK dependency, pinning and preflight approach.
- [Migration design](../docs/XBOX360_REXGLUE_MIGRATION.md) — boundaries and gates.
- [Status ledger](../coordination/xbox360_rexglue_status.json) — evidence-backed milestone states.

Expected future directories (create only with proven content): `analysis/` for metadata-only XEX reports; `runtime/` for SHIFT-specific Xbox service adapters; `render/` for verified Xbox GPU integration; `platform/` for host-specific glue; `tests/` for exact regression fixtures. Keep files and conventions aligned with ReXGlue's actual pinned CLI/API once tested.

## Input record

The user-provided retail `default.xex` is kept outside Git. Its SHA-256, title ID, media ID and build metadata are recorded in the gate ledger and [preflight evidence](../evidence/xbox360_rexglue_preflight_20261022.md). Do not upload or commit copyrighted binaries, extracted assets or generated translations.

The PC `SHIFT.exe` supplied for the legacy workstream is **not** a substitute for `default.xex`.

## First proof

Pin an upstream SDK commit and produce a reproducible analyzer/compiler report for this exact XEX, including recognized code/functions, import/API dependencies, errors and next blocker. The current `0.10.0` package run is preliminary because its source commit is not yet pinned. No project-specific build command is presented as working.
