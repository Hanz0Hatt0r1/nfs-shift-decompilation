# SHIFT Decompilation Roadmap

This document tracks the current execution order. Detailed historical work is preserved in `docs/PHASE*.md`.

## Current milestone: specialized-provider runtime capture

**Current mainline: Phase 505.**



Phases 499–500 make the specialized-provider capture directory self-describing:

- pre/post snapshots are indexed by provider id and hit;
- duplicate and missing stages are detected;
- pre snapshots define structural readiness;
- optional post snapshots enable reset→solve order analysis;
- scalar-reset events can be scoped by frame index;
- results are emitted as `SHIFT.SpecializedProviderCaptureBundleRuntime/1`;
- the verification CLI returns 0 for ready evidence and 2 for blocked evidence.

Exact retail/provider numeric parity remains open until a real runtime frame is captured.

## Immediate execution order

1. Python CI baseline after the `src` reorganization — complete; Phase 504 mainline CI is green; Phase 505 is the current source/control-flow extension.
2. Capture a real provider frame with the SDF/runtime probe — preflight implemented; live capture remains the next evidence gate.
3. Verify the provider bundle together with `scalar_reset_events.jsonl`.
4. Cross-vehicle raw BFF payload parity and deduplicated FXO shader profiling — complete.
5. Corpus-driven shader opcode gap analysis — complete.
6. Cross-path content-addressed raw payload reuse audit — implemented as `SHIFT.BFFRawPayloadReuseAudit/1`.
7. Propagate FXO/resource provenance into `RenderCommand/1` and add `SHIFT.NativeSubmissionGate/1` for native execution — complete, including persisted gate enforcement in Python/C++.
8. Extend runtime BMW shader join/render contracts with explicit VS/PS/pair byte-hash differentials — implemented.
9. Join provider dispatch/selector/execution/source-shape evidence into the capture handoff contract — implemented as `SHIFT.SpecializedProviderCaptureHandoffRuntime/1`.
10. Compare retail packed-workspace/output mutations with the source-derived provider programs — implemented as `SHIFT.SpecializedProviderCaptureSourceMutationCorrelation/1`.
11. Continue closing pre-PhysX construction boundaries without inventing SDK/provider class identities — Phase 502 cross-contract validator and Phase 503 BFF-to-handoff orchestration are complete.
12. Validate the runtime capture host before attempting GDB attachment — Phase 504 preflight implemented.
13. Close the IGPhaseVehicle participant creation/load gate before runtime capture — Phase 505 implemented.
14. Expand the desktop reference renderer against real BMW material/shader permutations.
15. Complete Vulkan RenderCommand execution using the same neutral contract.
16. Continue SGB/FLAT and camera runtime reconstruction.
17. Derive proven animation poses from the BAB runtime grammar.
18. Port the stable native render/runtime boundary to Android.
19. Integrate gameplay/input/audio/streaming only after the core data and render/runtime contracts stabilize.

## Workstream status

| Workstream | State | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| BFF/XMem-LZX | verified | broader uncommon-variant coverage |
| Resource IR | active | remaining format-specific joins |
| MEB / vertex ABI | strong static | more runtime same-instance proofs |
| Material/shader linking | implemented | broader real permutation validation |
| Desktop renderer | active oracle | broader exact D3D9/material coverage |
| Skinning | contract implemented | runtime pose production |
| BAB animation | evidence-backed | resolve remaining semantic gaps |
| SGB scene | partial | deeper object/leaf consumers |
| Camera | active | higher-level behavior |
| Vehicle physics | active | runtime graph, participant gate and force-law boundaries; BFF-to-pre-PhysX handoff implemented |
| Builtin solver | source-backed | runtime frame parity |
| Specialized providers | capture-ready | real capture + numeric differential; source-mutation and pre-PhysX handoff correlation implemented |
| D3D9 capture | mature | more real same-instance evidence |
| Vulkan | active | full RenderCommand/material submission |
| Android | deferred | stable native renderer/runtime boundary |

## Canonical render path

`BFF → IR → VHF/MEB/BMT/DDS → FX/FXO → RenderBinding/1 → DrawPacket/1 → StaticDraw/1 → RenderCommand/1`

The reference renderer and Vulkan backend consume the same neutral command/data contract.

## Runtime evidence path

`D3D9 producer → JSONL → draw-local snapshot → identity correlation → same-instance gate → parity`

For large captures:

`apitrace → unique BMW extraction → optional trim → payload proof`

## Physics path

`CDF/EDF/GDF/SDF → VehiclePhysicsAssetGraph/1 → participant gate → construction → solver frame → provider/builtin → post-solve`

The provider branch is currently structurally reconstructed but numerically capture-gated.

## First native vehicle-slice definition

The first reproducible native slice requires:

- exact resource identity;
- deterministic material/shader selection;
- validated RenderCommand;
- deterministic reference output;
- Vulkan execution of the same command;
- explicit external renderer-global resources;
- no runtime dependency on original BFF parsing.

Physics equivalence is a separate workstream.
